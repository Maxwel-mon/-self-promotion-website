      <h1>Inroduction</h1>
      <p>"The world of computers is growing at an un-recordable rate everyday, computers are the most influential tools in our lives, they are our present and future.
         In my opinion nothing on the planet can measure the exponential growth and excitement in the computing industry, an industry which Im yet to be a part of,
          particularly computer science. My name is Maxwel Agure Monday ,I was born on 6/11/2000 in the capitla of kenya, Nairobi.Curently i am a BSC.Hons Computer Science 
          student at Sheffield Hallam University .</p>

      <h1>Why Me ?</h1>
      <h2>Passionate</h2>
    </p>As a computer scientist im passionate about being part of creating amaizing and imersive technollogy that not only changes peoples interaction with technlogy but makes it a mesmorizzing life experience.
    One of the things i love abbout being a computer scientist is watching my month work yield relatively usefull programs like temperature conversion tools that not only simplify but increases the effeciency and accuracy of these tasks. 

    </p>
      <h2>Consistently Inovative </h2>
      <p>considering my self as inovative is not a mistake .After propossing the idea for hosting a games tournament for a charity organisation which hellped them indirectly increase their donation fund.I woiuld not be wrong to say i turn ideas into projects and projects into simple succes.


      </p>
    <h2>Creative</h2>
    <p> One of my most creative experiences would be being incharge of a team of 15 well motivated individuals we managed to develope and update five websites for different upcoming charity organisations within a spesific time period.This not only shows my organisation skills but the ability to meet deadlines and work under constant pressure .</p>

    <h2>Team Player</h2>
    <p>from  my various experiences like being a school team rugby palyer ,doing group projects in uninversit and participating in the daily activities of charity organisations i believe i have greatoly improved my abillity of working or leading a team.   
    </p>
