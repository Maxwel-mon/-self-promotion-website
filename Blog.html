      <h1>RUGBY.</h1>
      
      <p>Amongst all the sports i have ever participated in i.e football, Lawn Tenis and Swiming rygby has always been my favourite.
        Though it seems like a dengarous game, playing rugby has realy improved my ability to communicate effectively as well as equiping me with 
      important team work skills.  </p>
      <p>Being an athlete while still studying is a whole new challenging.But from past expereience, getting to kno how to balance my co-curricular 
        activites with my education has enhanced my not only my abbility to multitask but also to yield  quality results in a short time while under pressusre.

      <h2>Team Building </h2>
      <p>
        As an international student addapting to new and copletely different environment can at times be challenging and time consuming.
        As for me , conformation into a completely new environment and way of life was relatively easy and simple.
        I made new friends easily and quickly by engaging in activities like GO CARTIIG 
        .This made us interact even more because it put everyone in a fun environment with less worries hence it strengthened our relationship and encouraged 
        everyone to help each other .
